                                <p>  This report was part of a “Dragon’s Den City Pitch” where I created a business pitch and presentation designed for the business and urban policy community of a country selected for me. It had to address issues of tourism, business, culture, leisure, politics, and geography as well as social issues. This project enabled me to refine my business pitching, presentation, and marketing skills.</p>

                                <p>My degree has taught me how to create a wide range of professional documents, including financial reports, Business pitches, research and analytical reports and policy briefs. Creating policy briefs gave me the skills to summarise a wide range of technical information into bite sized pieces of information that can be easily understood by a wide range of people with different understandings of the topic in question. It also refined my research skills and allowed me to use my more creative side when designing the layout of the policy brief. The visual aspect of the policy brief is equally as important as the information as it dictates how the audience will read and digest the information. </p>
